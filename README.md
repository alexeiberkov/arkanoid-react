Simple React Webpack Arkanoid Game

Very simple game of old game Arkanoid made with ReactJS. You can include this game into your application. 

### What's in it?

* Simple src/index.jsx and src/index.css (local module css).
* Webpack configuration for development (with hot reloading) and production (with minification).
* CSS module loading, so you can include your css by ```import styles from './path/to.css';```.
* Both js(x) and css hot loaded during development.

### To run

* You'll need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.
* Fork and clone the project:

```
> $ git clone THIS_REPO_URL
```

* Then install the dependencies:

```
> $ npm install
```

* Run development server:

```
> $ npm start
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8888/`
